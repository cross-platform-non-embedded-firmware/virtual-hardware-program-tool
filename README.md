# 1st ever VMT(virtual machine tool)
In general summarization, it’s supposed to go lower for being like a (opening & closing) backdoor type of "entrance" for accessing data even from what there in the block pages prior to having been erased in said pages in the NAND blocks, cause to overwrite a block page, 1st they need to erase the date in it, hence that’s the main goal as to what exactly we’re trying to achieve with this particular project, that’s the point of what this non-embedded cross platform firmware tool/application is pretty much supposed to about exactly do. Like embedded firmware , non-embedded firmware is also used to control the limited, set functions of hardware devices and systems of greater complexity but still gives more appliance-like usage instead of a series of terminal commands, however, it's not limited to being embedded in a certain device, hence making it be able to be cross platform
