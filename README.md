of course, do also note that we're actually planning to go about it in a different way, rather than a "direct recovery" per say, but instead, seeing back into the data (if not, then at least the contents of which) that was there in the block pages prior to erasal,  like as if by means of being able to detect it through something like the faint sent/print/stain/smudge of the data that was there, cause to overwrite something in NAND flash, 1st they erase the data inside the block pages, hence we're not really exactly "saving" anything, it's supposed to be like infrared ghost detection radar/gear   exactly straight up just call/address/refer to it as a virtual hardware program/tool, cause calling it anything else could give people the wrong impression/idea about as to what this actually is, being that, everything I'd just told you about it, along with all the info regarding it in the logs for the pseudo-server that this project shall be taking place in, and on that note, you can also call it a vital hardware program, or just hardware program too, as those actually are other names that accurately describe this project that we’re trying to make now as to also answer some more of your likely questions that you might (still) have, I have my MacBook Air for you guys to test this on, also, the team’s assigned to help each other with doing any &amp; every part of it, depending on the individual team member’s own strengths/abilities, now don’t say that I’m rushing it, cause “rushing” is by means of procrastination, hence it technically wouldn’t be as rushed if you dedicated enough your time to committing to this project, paired with the fact that as of now, I only want you to just test/make this work on 2013-2014 &amp; 2017(cause not much in different in any way between them) MacBook Air SSDs as of currently for now, as I’m sure that lesson’s the required work load by a (seemingly) significant amount, after my high school, when the project is finished, then you can add, edit, “improve on”, make a NOR version, etc. and on the last note (for now), like I mentioned, we’re compiling all the languages I mentioned, cause this would be a 1st for both the XNU and overall Apple platform in general, along with also being so for when it comes to a GUI “software”(mostly hardware virtualization) that gives you ease of use &amp; control
