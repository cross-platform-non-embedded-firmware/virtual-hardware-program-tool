# 1st ever VMT(virtual machine tool)
We’re going to be creating a sort of application/tool that’s supposed to go lower-level to do what a physical tool does on any actual computer, but yet this time with also be utilizing deep learning to accurately self-reconstruct a visual model of whatever the previous form of the data was. And going along with that, the tool’s also supposed to feature a bit reallocation process that’s based the concept of what a FAT is/does, but combining that with manipulating the bits to cycle back through previous states, in essence, it's obviously not traditional data recovery that we're doing here. But rather a recovery tool to switch betwen previous data forms, and try to recover any possible data out of it.
